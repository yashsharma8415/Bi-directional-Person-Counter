# Bi-directional Person Counter

A bi-directional person counter is a device which can be used to monitor the number of objects entering/exiting through it. If it is set up at the entrance of a shop, it displays the number of visitors currently inside the shop. To increase its functionality, an LED is used which glows when there is at least one person inside the shop. Also whenever the number of visitors becomes greater than some threshold value, a buzzer can be used and can be turned on.

More details about the theory and code analysis can be found in the report.
